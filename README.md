# Ei-2024-25_Assiment_2
Here I have implemented Q3 in Assignment 2 i.e,
Mars Rover Programming<br>
I have tried my best to implement Command abd Composite Pattern<br>
The Command pattern is implemented by MoveCommand,TurnLeftCommand and TurnRightCommand Classes<br>
The Composite pattern is implemented by MarseRoverSimulation,Rover and Grid<br>
Please refer to the attached UML diagram <br>
The logic approach was inspired by the DSA question that I solved few days back <a href="url">Leetcode</a><br>
ThankYou! also Outputs Screenshots are attached.
